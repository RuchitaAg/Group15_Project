# Group15_Project - Global Carbon Emission Comparisons


## Rationale for topic selection: 

Given the alarming rates of carbon emissions we were keen to:

● Study major factors affecting climate conditions

● Analyze correlations between energy usage and GHG emissions through transportation

● Determine the recent impact of alternative energy sources

● Predict future impact of higher alternative energy adoption



## Data Description:

● Annual worldwide vehicle mix by different energy types
 (Diesel, Electric, Hybrid, etc.)
 
● Overall GHG emissions by sector

● Market demand of all vehicles types

● Energy production


## Database:

● Downloaded datasets related to co2 emissions and GHG emissions.
○ Source - https://ourworldindata.org/ 

● Tried to find the unique key to merge the data in this case it is the country name and year

● Collected the datasets for Transport Vehicle demand country wise and year wise, merged it with the GHG emissions database


## Database Sample:

## Machine Learning Model Summary:

< PNG >

## Machine Learning Model - Data columns:

●  To calculate CO2 emissions saved by electric vehicles year by year

● Features given in the screenshot are taken into consideration

< PNG >

## Next Steps:


● Explore and analyze data to study the impact of various
vehicles by energy type on carbon emission

● Determine if there is a significant correlation between
each factor

● Reveal possible outcomes of alternate energy
consumption on carbon & GHG emissions

● Summarize each step taken in the machine learning
preprocess
